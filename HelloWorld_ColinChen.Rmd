```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is a markdown file"

This is **Colin Chen's** first R markdown file ever written in the data science course from *JHU*. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
