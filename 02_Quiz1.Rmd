Question 11
-----------
In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?

### Answer
Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, Temp, Month, Day

```R

# Use read.csv to read from data
quiz1 <- read.csv('./data/hw1_data.csv')

# Use names function to extract column names for data
names(quiz1)

```

Question 12
-----------
Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

### Answer
	  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
	1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
	2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2

```R
# call out 1st two rows from the read data set
quiz1[c(1,2),]
quiz1[1:2, ] 

OR

# First two rows by using head function
head(quiz1,2)
```

Question 13
-----------
How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?

### Answer
153

```R
# Use nrow to show the number of rows in data frame as an one element vector
nrow(quiz1)

OR

# Use dim to show the dimension vector consists of row and column size into one vector
dim(quiz1)
```

Question 14
-----------
Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does the output look like?

### Answer

	   Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
	152    18     131  8.0   76     9  29
	153    20     223 11.5   68     9  30

```R
# Can use tails to extract the last 2 rows
tail(quiz_data, 2)

OR

# Use subsetting to call out the last 2 rows
quiz1[c(152,153),]
quiz1[152:153, ] 
```

Question 15
-----------
What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?

### Answer
21

```R
quiz1[47, 'Ozone']

OR

quiz1$Ozone[47]
```

Question 16
-----------
How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?

### Answer
37

```R
# Going back to data.frame because dont it hasnt been taught yet in this specialization
quiz_data = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
sub = subset(quiz_data, is.na(Ozone))
nrow(sub)

```

```R
# Can also remmove Missing Values using Something like This
quiz_data[complete.cases(quiz_data),]
```

Question 17
-----------
What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded as NA) from this calculation.

### Answer
42.1

### Explanation
The 'mean' function can be used to calculate the mean.

```R
hw1 = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
sub = subset(hw1, !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
apply(sub, 2, mean) 
```

Question 18
-----------
Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?

### Answer
212.8

```R
quiz_data = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
sub = subset(quiz_data, Ozone > 31 & Temp > 90, select = Solar.R)
apply(sub, 2, mean)
```

Question 19
-----------
What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?

### Answer
79.1

### Explanation

```R
quiz_data = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
sub = subset(hw1, Month == 6, select = Temp)
apply(sub, 2, mean)
```

Question 20
-----------
What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?

### Answer
115

### Explantion

```R
quiz_data = read.csv('hw1_data.csv')
sub = subset(quiz_data, Month == 5 & !is.na(Ozone), select = Ozone)
apply(sub, 2, max)

NOTE: If we wanted more columns to display for sub we can achieve this by the following:
sub = subset(quiz_data, Month == 5 & !is.na(Ozone), select = c(Ozone, Solar.R, Day))
```
