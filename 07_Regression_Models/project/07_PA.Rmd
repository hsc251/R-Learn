# Project Introduction

This project assignment is to look at a data set of car collections in 1974 (**mtcars**), and the two main questions this project would like to know the following questions.

1. "Is automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"?
2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

# Preliminary Setup & Understanding the Data Structure.

Load the respective libraries for plotting before implementing the statistics commands.
```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)

# load data table into the abbreviation
mtc <- mtcars

# Understand the data structure
sapply(mtc, class)
```

And by looking at the data structure, variable *am* is the transmission type (where 0 = automatic and 1 = manual from **?mtcars**'s justification). Therefore the model will definitely have this as an inclusion.

# Initial Model Setup.

In this particular model, we have used the factor labels to place the am as an identified parameter to indicate the 2 different population for comparison. 
```{R}
# Use factor to label transmission
mtc$am <- factor(mtc$am, labels = c("Auto", "Manual"))

ggplot(data = mtc, aes(x = am, y = mpg))+ geom_boxplot(aes(fill = am)) + ggtitle("Transmission Type's Miles Per Gallon Comparison Plot")

fit <- lm(mpg ~ am, data =mtc)
```
