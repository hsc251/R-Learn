# (Base R Visualization) Getting Started with Data Visualization in R Quiz 4 Summary

Description: This is the summary quiz Colin took during his learning journey for JHU's Data Visualization & Dashboarding with R Specialization.</br>

Question 1
----------
Why is it helpful to be able to use functions like rnorm, rpois. rbinom, and runif? </br>

### Answer
- [ ] These functions will check whether your data conform with common data distributions, which tells you what kind of plot you should make with those data.
- [ ] These functions tell R to draw the underlying distributions as figures, and this is a good way to see what different figures look like.
- [x] These functions will generate arbitrary numbers quickly that you can use to test visualization functions.
- [ ] These functions will draw figures of the distributions, and you need to be able to distinguish between these different functions quickly if you are going to visualize data successfully.
</br>

### Remarks
You can use these functions to quickly create "fake" data that you can use to draw practice figures.</br>

Question 2
----------
What is a histogram? </br>

### Answer
- [ ] A histogram is a time-series figure that displays historical patterns of change in a vector.
- [x] A histogram is a bar chart of the frequencies for different discrete values in a vector.
- [ ] A histogram is a way to display bivariate data that includes discrete values in multiple columns.
</br>

### Remarks
A histogram is a way to visualize univariate data. </br>

Question 3
----------
How do you add titles and labels to figures you create with plot()? </br>

### Answer
- [ ] Use the "options=" argument in plot() and include the different labels as elements of a vector.
- [x] Add options like "main=", "xlab=", or "ylab=" as additional arguments in the function.
- [ ] First, draw a figure using plot() and save it as an object. Then, use the format_plot() function to add these labels.
</br>

### Remarks
Consult the R documentation for plot to refresh your understanding. </br>

Question 4
----------
What is the easiest way to export a figure you create in RStudio? </br>

### Answer
- [ ] In the plot function, use the option "output=[your file path].
- [ ] Zoom out on the plot pane and take a screen snip.
- [x] In the plot pane, click export, then click "Save as Image" or "Save as PDF".
</br>

### Remarks
This is the most user-friendly way to exporting figures. </br>

Question 5
----------
By default, what is the first argument in the plot() function? </br>

### Answer
- [x] The x variable
- [ ] The plot title
- [ ] The data frame that you are pulling vectors from for the figure.
- [ ] The plot type
- [ ] The y variable
</br>

### Remarks
N/A. </br>
